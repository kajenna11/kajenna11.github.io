        In the UK and Ireland, adult male chickens over the age of one year are primarily known as cocks, 
        whereas in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, they are more commonly called 
        roosters. Males less than a year old are cockerels.[10] Castrated roosters are called capons 
        (surgical and chemical castration are now illegal in some parts of the world). Females over a year 
        old are known as hens, and younger females as pullets,[11] although in the egg-laying industry, 
        a pullet becomes a hen when she begins to lay eggs, at 16 to 20 weeks of age. In Australia and 
        New Zealand (also sometimes in Britain), there is a generic term chook /tʃʊk/ to describe all 
        ages and both sexes.[12] The young are often called chicks.
        "Chicken" originally referred to young domestic fowl.[13] The species as a whole was then called 
        domestic fowl, or just fowl. This use of "chicken" survives in the phrase "Hen and Chickens", 
        sometimes used as a British public house or theatre name, and to name groups of one large and 
        many small rocks or islands in the sea (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).
        In the Deep South of the United States, chickens are also referred to by the slang term yardbird.[14]

        Cattle were originally identified as three separate species: Bos taurus, the European or "taurine" 
        cattle (including similar types from Africa and Asia); Bos indicus, the zebu; and the extinct Bos 
        primigenius, the aurochs. The aurochs is ancestral to both zebu and taurine cattle.[4] These have 
        been reclassified as one species, Bos taurus, with three subspecies: Bos taurus primigenius, Bos 
        taurus indicus, and Bos taurus taurus.[5][6]
        Complicating the matter is the ability of cattle to interbreed with other closely related species. 
        Hybrid individuals and even breeds exist, not only between taurine cattle and zebu (such as the sanga 
        cattle, Bos taurus africanus), but also between one or both of these and some other members of the 
        genus Bos – yaks (the dzo or yattle[7]), banteng, and gaur. Hybrids such as the beefalo breed can 
        even occur between taurine cattle and either species of bison, leading some authors to consider them 
        part of the genus Bos, as well.[8] The hybrid origin of some types may not be obvious – for example, 
        genetic testing of the Dwarf Lulu breed, the only taurine-type cattle in Nepal, found them to be 
        a mix of taurine cattle, zebu, and yak.[9] However, cattle cannot be successfully hybridized with 
        more distantly related bovines such as water buffalo or African buffalo.
        The aurochs originally ranged throughout Europe, North Africa, and much of Asia. In historical times, 
        its range became restricted to Europe, and the last known individual died in Mazovia, Poland, in about 
        1627.[10] Breeders have attempted to recreate cattle of similar appearance to aurochs by crossing 
        traditional types of domesticated cattle, creating the Heck cattle breed.

      <h2 class="text-center">Sushi</h2>
      <p>
        Sushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish, known as narezushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司 – "salted fish"), 
        stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time. The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevented 
        the fish from spoiling;[3] the rice would be discarded before consumption of the fish.[4] This early 
        type of sushi became an important source of protein for its Japanese consumers. The term sushi 
        literally means "sour-tasting" and comes from an antiquated し (shi) terminal-form conjugation, 
        酸し sushi, no longer used in other contexts, of the adjectival verb 酸い sui "to be sour";[5] 
        the overall dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste.[6] Narezushi still exists as a regional 
        specialty, notably as funa-zushi from Shiga Prefecture.[7]
        Osaka-style sushi, also called "Oshi-zushi" or "hako-sushi" Vinegar began to be added to the 
        preparation of narezushi in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) for the sake of enhancing both taste 
        and preservation. In addition to increasing the sourness of the rice, the vinegar significantly 
        increased the dish's longevity, causing the fermentation process to be shortened and eventually 
        abandoned. The primitive sushi would be further developed in Osaka, where over several centuries 
        it became oshi-zushi or "hako-zushi"; in this preparation, the seafood and rice were pressed into 
        shape with wooden (typically bamboo) molds.
        It was not until the Edo period (1603–1868) that fresh fish was served over vinegared rice and 
        nori. The particular style of today's nigirizushi became popular in Edo (contemporary Tokyo) 
        in the 1820s or 1830s. One common story of nigirizushi's origins is of the chef Hanaya Yohei 
        (1799–1858), who invented or perfected the technique in 1824 at his shop in Ryōgoku.[7] The 
        dish was originally termed Edomae zushi as it used freshly caught fish from the Edo-mae (Edo 
        or Tokyo Bay); the term Edomae nigirizushi is still used today as a by-word for quality sushi, 
        regardless of its ingredients' origins.[8][9]
        The earliest written mention of sushi in English described in the Oxford English Dictionary is 
        in an 1893 book, A Japanese Interior, where it mentions sushi as "a roll of cold rice with fish, 
        sea-weed, or some other flavoring".[10][11] There is an earlier mention of sushi in James Hepburn's 
        Japanese-English dictionary from 1873,[12] and an 1879 article on Japanese cookery in the journal 
        Notes and Queries.[13]
